I am developing an application that needs to access serial ports both under
OS/2 and Win32. Because SIBYL doesn't provide a component for this purpose, 
I decided to write my own.
The OS/2 information was available on the SpeedSoft website, and fortunately,
I found an article by Jason Perry on internet, describing a DELPHI component
to access the serial ports.
(www.oop.com/white_papers/delphi/serial-communication.htm)

The object allows you to define the normal serial communications parameters
(baudrate, statbits, stopbits and parity) and also defines the necessary
hooks to implement hard or software handshaking if desired.

I also added a timer to poll the port and to warn the program when there is data
waiting to be read.

There are two ways to obtain the data. You can specify that the data comes in
strings (ended by CR or LF) or in chars.
When you specify strings, (DataType = dtString) the OnStringRead method will be called whenever the
control has read a complete string. This procedure should call the ReadString method to obtain the string 
read.
When you specify chars, (DataType = dtChars) the OnCharsRead method is called. This procedure should call
first the BytesInQue function to find out how many characters are waiting to be read, define a memory area
big enough to contain the data and call the GetData function to read the required number of bytes.

The SendData method sends the data to the comport.

I included a small program that shows how to use the component. The program opens the comport
and waits for string data to arrive. The received data appears on the screen.
When you push the SEND button, all the received data will be send to the comport.
